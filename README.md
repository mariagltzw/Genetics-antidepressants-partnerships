Code for replicating the analysis of the paper "Genetic Propensity to Depression and the Role of Partnership Status"

In this paper, we examined the association of a polygenic index for depression with time to antidepressant purchasing and the moderating role of partnership status using Finnish survey and register data. We perform subgroup analyses by gender. The code provided is for replicating the main analysis. If you are interested in replicating the sensitivity analysis feel free to reach out!

The data source for this analysis is the genotyped sample of the FINRISK and Health 2000 and 2011 surveys, linked with Finnish register data. The data is not publicly available and we do not have permission to share the data. Script 1 is only needed if you want to replicate the findings with the same data. I included a test dataset that can be used to run scripts 2-5 if you are interested in running the code. The test dataset does not resemble the distributions of the original dataset that was used for the analysis of our paper.
